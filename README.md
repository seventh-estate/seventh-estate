# Seventh Estate: Grassroots Democracy

## Overview
Seventh Estate empowers grassroots democracy. With modern advances in
cryptography, Anyone can now prove that a majority of the country
agrees with a particular petition statement.  The technique offers
the best of surveys, initiatives, juries, protests, and petitions,
while overcoming their shortcomings in demonstrating the public will.

With it, anyone can now for the first time irrefutably prove that a
majority would sign on to particular petition language.  All that’s
needed is about $1,000 worth of supplies and a postal mailing list
for the country or region.

The list is sampled in a way that is irrefutably random and
un-manipulatable.  Those receiving ballots are given time to research
and submit their decision securely online. They know that their input
is significant because of the limited sample size. They also know
that it will be counted correctly, because the security is
superior to that of conventional automated election systems. In fact,
observers can verify that those creating and mailing the paper
ballots cannot influence selection, manipulate outcomes, or link
responses to addresses. Vote-buying, an unsolved problem in all other
current non-polling- place balloting, is effectively solved by decoy
ballots. Economic incentives can be provided to those casting ballots
without any possible linkage to their response.

The needed supplies are readily available and have already been
tested, the server backend can be part of any blockchain, and the
poll can be announced only after the ballots are mailed, making
interference all but impossible.

## Installation

Clone this repository as described at
[Cloning a repository \- GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

You'll also need to install the Rust language, as explained at
[Install Rust \- Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Next, run `cargo build`. This will install all the dependencies, and
compile them into an executable in `target/debug/seventh-estate`.

Run `target/debug/seventh-estate --help` to confirm that it built
successfully and learn the command-line options available.

## Run the Demo

`cd` to the examples folder, and run

`SEVENTH_ESTATE_BINARY=../target/debug/seventh-estate ./example-debug.sh 2>&1 | tee example.out`

The output is shown in the console, and also captured in the file `example.out`.

When it asks for a password, for the demo, you can just make one up
and enter it consistently.

## Interpreting the results of the demo
Watch the Seventh Estate [Demonstration Video](https://youtu.be/v20n5pXAcvQ) for
an explanation of the steps in a poll.

Briefly, here is the sequence of events, identified by the
`seventh-estate` command used, and which files to look at for
results.

```
new: Create a new poll
 examples/example.yaml.secure (changed in later steps also)

bind-roster: Bind the roster of voters to the poll
 examples/example.yaml.secure

step 1: Generate initial commitments
 examples/ExamplePoll/committed_plane_*.csv
 examples/ExamplePoll/committed_roster.csv
 examples/ExamplePoll/committed_summands.yaml

step 2: Generate drawn summands
 examples/ExamplePoll/drawn_summands.yaml

step 3: Generate address labels and ballot information
 examples/addresses.csv
 examples/ballots.csv

step 4: Record audited (spoiled) ballots
 examples/ExamplePoll/print_audit_plane_*.csv
 examples/ExamplePoll/print_audit_plane_*_keys.csv

step 5: Ballot casting (the demo script chooses random votes)
 examples/votes.csv

step 6: Record votes
 examples/ExamplePoll/vote_plane_*.csv
 examples/ExamplePoll/vote_plane_*_keys.csv

step 7: Tally audit draw
 examples/ExamplePoll/audited_columns.yaml

step 8: Reveal tally and audit it
 examples/ExamplePoll/final_plane_*.csv
 examples/ExamplePoll/final_plane_*_keys.csv
 examples/ExamplePoll/committed_summands_key.key
 examples/ExamplePoll/committed_summands_revealed.csv
```
